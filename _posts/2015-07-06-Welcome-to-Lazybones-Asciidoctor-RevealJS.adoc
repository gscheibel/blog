= Welcome to Lazybones Asciidoctor-RevealJS

:hp-tags: asciidoctor, revealjs, laszybones

After couple of months, I finally found a topic to create the very first topic in my new http://hubpress.io/[Hubpress.io] blog.

Today, we are going to talk about *Asciidoctor* and *RevealJS*. As you might know, you can use Asciidoctor to write and create RevealJS presentations. Therefore, if you are not familiar with Asciidoctor creating the first presentation can be tricky especially if you plan to use diagrams (or other external modules).

Recently thanks to Andres Almiray (https://twitter.com/aalmiray[@aalmiray]), I discovered https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones[Lazybones]. A `very` simple template generator for Gradle project. With Lazybones you can start a Gradle project such as Spring boot, Groovy or even Asciidoctor therefore you still had to  customize the generated project to be able to generate a RevealJS slideshow.
