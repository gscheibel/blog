= Writting macro with Asciidoctor
:hp-tags: asciidoctor, macro, groovy

When you start with a lightweight markup language such as Asciidoctor, the first thing you have to learn is to understand and learn the syntax.
Alongside with this new language, you have your own functionnal language with its own references and shortcuts.
In the Asciidoctor world, enhancing the default syntax with your own language is called `writting an macro`.

Let's say, you're writting release notes in which you're referencing Github issues.
Instead of copying the issue link all the time, it could be interesting to create an macro that will create the link for you.
Once the macro created, you'll be able to write something like `github:9999` instead of `https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/9999`. If Github decides to change the issues URLs, you'll need to update the macro and not all the links you used.
